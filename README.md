Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ExpressJS] - NodeJS Frameowrk to create REST API.
- [Sequelize] - ORM Library for ExpressJS.
- [React-Native] - Framework to create crossplatform mobile phone application.
- [React-Native-Papper] - great UI boilerplate for moderen, light and simple phone application.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd group-management/backend-test
npm i
npm start
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.
